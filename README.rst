Welcome
-------

`MICOM` is a Python package for metabolic modeling of microbial
communities currently developed in the
`Gibbons Lab <https://gibbons.systemsbiology.org>`_ at the `Institute for Systems
Biology <https://systemsbiology.org>`_ and the
`Human Systems Biology Group <https://resendislab.github.io>`_ of
Prof. Osbaldo Resendis Antonio at the `National Institute of Genomic
Medicine Mexico <https://inmegen.gob.mx>`_.

`MICOM` allows you to construct a community model from a list on input
COBRA models and manages exchange fluxes between individuals and individuals
with the environment. It explicitly accounts for different abundances of
individuals in the community and can thus incorporate data from biomass quantification,
cytometry, ampliconsequencing, or metagenomic shotgun sequencing.

It identifies a relevant flux space by incorporating an ecological model for the trade-off
between individual taxa growth and community-wide growth that shows good agreement with
experimental data.
