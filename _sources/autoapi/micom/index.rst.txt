.. class:: Community(taxonomy, model_db=None, id=None, name=None, rel_threshold=1e-06, solver=None, progress=True, max_exchange=100, mass=1)


   Bases: :py:obj:`cobra.Model`

   A community of models.

   This class represents a community of individual models. It was designed for
   microbial communities but may also be used for multi-tissue or tissue-cell
   mixture models as long as all individuals exist within a single enclosing
   compartment.

   .. method:: __add_exchanges(self, reactions, info, external_compartment='e', internal_exchange=1000)

      Add exchange reactions for a new model.


   .. method:: __update_exchanges(self)

      Update exchanges.


   .. method:: __update_community_objective(self)

      Update the community objective.


   .. method:: optimize_single(self, id)

      Optimize growth rate for one individual.

      `optimize_single` will calculate the maximal growth rate for one
      individual member of the community.

      .. rubric:: Notes

      This might well mean that growth rates for all other individuals are
      low since the individual may use up all available resources.

      :param id: The ID of the individual to be optimized.
      :type id: str
      :param fluxes: Whether to return all fluxes. Defaults to just returning the
                     maximal growth rate.
      :type fluxes: boolean, optional

      :returns: The maximal growth rate for the given taxa.
      :rtype: float


   .. method:: optimize_all(self, progress=False)

      Return solutions for individually optimizing each model.

      .. rubric:: Notes

      This might well mean that growth rates for all other individuals are
      low since the individual may use up all available resources. As a
      consequence the reported growth rates may usually never be obtained
      all at once.

      :param progress: Whether to show a progress bar.
      :type progress: boolean, optional

      :returns: The maximal growth rate for each taxa.
      :rtype: pandas.Series


   .. method:: optimize(self, fluxes=False, pfba=False, raise_error=False, atol=None, rtol=None)

      Optimize the model using flux balance analysis.

      :param slim: Whether to return a slim solution which does not contain fluxes,
                   just growth rates.
      :type slim: boolean, optional
      :param raise_error: Should an error be raised if the solution is not optimal. Defaults
                          to False which will either return a solution with a non-optimal
                          status or None if optimization fails.
      :type raise_error: boolean, optional
      :param fluxes: Whether to return the fluxes as well.
      :type fluxes: boolean, optional
      :param pfba: Whether to obtain fluxes by parsimonious FBA rather than
                   "classical" FBA. This is highly recommended.
      :type pfba: boolean, optional
      :param atol: Absolute tolerance for the growth rates. If None will use the solver
                   tolerance.
      :type atol: float
      :param rtol: Relative tolerqance for the growth rates. If None will use the
                   solver tolerance.
      :type rtol: float

      :returns: The solution after optimization or None if there is no optimum.
      :rtype: micom.CommunitySolution


   .. method:: abundances(self)
      :property:

      pandas.Series: The normalized abundances.

      Setting this attribute will also trigger the appropriate updates in
      the exchange fluxes and the community objective.


   .. method:: set_abundance(self, value, normalize=True)

      Change abundances for one or more taxa.

      :param value: The new abundances. Must contain one value for each taxon. Can
                    be a named object like a pandas Series.
      :type value: array-like object
      :param normalize: Whether to normalize the abundances to a total of 1.0. Many things
                        in micom asssume that this is always the case. Only change this
                        if you know what you are doing :O
      :type normalize: boolean, optional


   .. method:: taxonomy(self)
      :property:

      pandas.DataFrame: The taxonomy used within the model.

      This attribute only returns a copy.


   .. method:: modification(self)
      :property:

      str: Denotes modifications to the model currently applied.

      Will be None if the community is unmodified.


   .. method:: exchanges(self)
      :property:

      list: Return all exchange reactions in the model.

      Uses several heuristics based on the reaction name and compartments
      to exclude reactions that are *not* exchange reactions.


   .. method:: internal_exchanges(self)
      :property:

      list: Return all internal exchanges.

      Internal exchanges are exchanges between individual taxa and the medium.


   .. method:: medium(self)
      :property:

      Return the medium.


   .. method:: build_metrics(self)
      :property:

      pd.Series: Returns general metrics for database matching.

      Only available when built using a model database.


   .. method:: optcom(self, strategy='lagrangian', min_growth=0.0, fluxes=False, pfba=True)

      Run OptCom for the community.

      OptCom methods are a group of optimization procedures to find community
      solutions that provide a tradeoff between the cooperative community
      growth and the egoistic growth of each individual [#c1]_. `micom`
      provides several strategies that can be used to find optimal solutions:

      - "moma": Minimization of metabolic adjustment. Simultaneously
        optimizes the community objective (maximize) and the cooperativity
        cost (minimize). This method finds an exact maximum but doubles the
        number of required variables, thus being slow.
      - "lmoma": The same as "moma" only with a linear
        representation of the cooperativity cost (absolute value).
      - "original": Solves the multi-objective problem described in [#c1]_.
        Here, the community growth rate is maximized simultanously with all
        individual growth rates. Note that there are usually many
        Pareto-optimal solutions to this problem and the method will only
        give one solution. This is also the slowest method.

      :param community: The community to optimize.
      :type community: micom.Community
      :param strategy: The strategy used to solve the OptCom formulation. Defaults to
                       "lagrangian" which gives a decent tradeoff between speed and
                       correctness.
      :type strategy: str
      :param min_growth: The minimal growth rate required for each individual. May be a
                         single value or an array-like object with the same length as there
                         are individuals.
      :type min_growth: float or array-like
      :param fluxes: Whether to return the fluxes as well.
      :type fluxes: boolean
      :param pfba: Whether to obtain fluxes by parsimonious FBA rather than
                   "classical" FBA.
      :type pfba: boolean

      :returns: The solution of the optimization. If fluxes==False will only
                contain the objective value, community growth rate and individual
                growth rates.
      :rtype: micom.CommunitySolution

   .. method:: cooperative_tradeoff(self, min_growth=0.0, fraction=1.0, fluxes=False, pfba=False, atol=None, rtol=None)

      Find the best tradeoff between community and individual growth.

      Finds the set of growth rates which maintian a particular community
      growth and spread up growth across all taxa as much as possible.
      This is done by minimizing the L2 norm of the growth rates with a
      minimal community growth.

      :param min_growth: The minimal growth rate required for each individual. May be a
                         single value or an array-like object with the same length as there
                         are individuals.
      :type min_growth: float or array-like, optional
      :param fraction: The minum percentage of the community growth rate that has to be
                       maintained. For instance 0.9 means maintain 90% of the maximal
                       community growth rate. Defaults to 100%.
      :type fraction: float or list of floats in [0, 1]
      :param fluxes: Whether to return the fluxes as well.
      :type fluxes: boolean, optional
      :param pfba: Whether to obtain fluxes by parsimonious FBA rather than
                   "classical" FBA. This is highly recommended.

      :param atol: Absolute tolerance for the growth rates. If None will use the solver
                   tolerance.
      :type atol: float
      :param rtol: Relative tolerqance for the growth rates. If None will use the
                   solver tolerance.
      :type rtol: float

      :returns: The solution of the optimization. If fluxes==False will only
                contain the objective value, community growth rate and individual
                growth rates. If more than one fraction value is given will return
                a pandas Series of solutions with the fractions as indices.
      :rtype: micom.CommunitySolution or pd.Series of solutions


   .. method:: knockout_taxa(self, taxa=None, fraction=1.0, method='change', progress=True, diag=True)

      Sequentially knowckout a list of taxa in the model.

      :param method: One of "raw", "change" or "relative change" that dictates whether
                     to return the new growth rate (raw), the change in growth rate
                     new - old or the relative change ([new - old] / old).

      :param progress: Whether to show a progress bar. On by default.
      :type progress: bool, optional

      :type diag: bool, optional

      :returns: A data frame with one row for each knockout and growth rates in the
                columns. Here the row name indicates which taxon has been knocked
                out and the columns contain the growth changes for all taxa in
                that knockout.
