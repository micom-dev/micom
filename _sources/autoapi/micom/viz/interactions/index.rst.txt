.. py:function:: plot_focal_interactions(results: micom.workflows.GrowthResults, taxon: str, filename: str = 'focal_interactions_%s.html' % datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d'), kind: str = 'mass') -> None

   Plot metabolic interactions between a focal taxa and all other taxa.

   This will visualize metabolic interaction between a taxon of interest (focal taxon)
   and all other taxa across all samples.

   :param results: The results returned by the `grow` workflow.
   :type results: micom.workflows.GrowthResults
   :param taxon: The focal taxon to use as a reference. Must be one of the taxa appearing
                 in `results.growth_rates.taxon`.
   :type taxon: str
   :param filename: The HTML file where the visualization will be saved.
   :type filename: str
   :param kind: Which kind of flux to use. Either
                - "flux": molar flux of a metabolite
                - "mass" (default): the mass flux (flux normalized by molecular weight)
                - "C": carbon flux
                - "N": nitrogen flux
   :type kind: str

   :returns: A MICOM visualization. Can be served with `viz.serve`.
   :rtype: Visualization


.. py:function:: plot_mes(results: micom.workflows.GrowthResults, filename: str = 'mes_%s.html' % datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d'), groups: pandas.Series = None, prevalence: float = 0.5) -> None

   Plot metabolic interactions between a focal taxa and all other taxa.

       This will plot the metabolic exchange score across samples and metabolites.
       The metabolic exchange score (MES) is defined as the geometric mean of the
       number of producers and consumers for a given metabolite in a sample.

       $$
       MES = 2\cdot
   rac{|p||c|}{|p| + |c|}
       $$

       Parameters
       ----------
       results : micom.workflows.GrowthResults
           The results returned by the `grow` workflow.
       filename : str
           The HTML file where the visualization will be saved.
       groups : pandas.Series
           Additional metadata to stratify MES score. The index must correspond to the
           `sample_id` in the results and values must be categorical. The `.name` attribute
           will be used to name the groups.
       prevalence : float in [0, 1]
           In what proportion of samples the metabolite has to have a non-zero MES to
           be shown on the plots. Can be used to show only very commonly exchanged
           metabolites.

       Notes
       -----
       The CSV files will always include all MES scores independent of the prevalence
       filter which is only used for visualization.

       Returns
       -------
       Visualization
           A MICOM visualization. Can be served with `viz.serve`.
