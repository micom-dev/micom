Welcome
-------

`MICOM` is a Python package for metabolic modeling of microbial
communities developed in the
`Gibbons Lab <https://gibbons.systemsbiology.org>`_ at the `Institute for Systems
Biology <https://systemsbiology.org>`_ and the
`Human Systems Biology Group <https://resendislab.github.io>`_ of
Prof. Osbaldo Resendis Antonio at the `National Institute of Genomic
Medicine Mexico <https://inmegen.gob.mx>`_.

`MICOM` allows you to construct a community model from a list on input
COBRA models and manages exchange fluxes between individuals and individuals
with the environment. It explicitly accounts for different abundances of
individuals in the community and can thus incorporate data from 16S amplicon
sequencing or metagenomic experiments. It allows optimization with a variety of algorithms
modeling the trade-off between egoistic growth rate maximization and
cooperative objectives.
