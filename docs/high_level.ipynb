    "# High level workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "The MICOM API can be cumbersome when working with many samples at once. To make this easier we provide premade workflows when working with several samples at once. All workflows assume the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have at least 2 samples with taxonomy assignments and abundances for each\n",
    "2. You have chosen to use one of the preused model databases or have already built your own\n",
    "3. You want to run a set of standard analyses and visualization on the models\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case the premade workflows will make your analysis much simpler and faster and will take care of parallelizing your analyses. The high level API can be mixed with the MICOM API at any point. So you could do a few steps with the premade workflows and then run you own analyses downstream from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input formats\n",
    "\n",
    "To start building community models for all your samples you will need to provide your data to MICOM. MICOM prefers to have the taxonomy and abundances for all samples in a single [tidy DataFrame](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). Here each taxon in each sample is a row which provides its taxonomy and abundance. This may sound a bit confusing but should become pretty cleat when looking at an example. MICOM can generate a simple example DataFrame which we can use as guidance."

    "This is very simple example where each sample contains 4 different *E. coli* species in random abundances. Thus, every sample has 4 rows in this DataFrame. The DataFrame also contains additional columns, **the only required columns are `id`, `sample_id`, `abundance` and one column that provides the summary rank, here `species`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we also have an additional column `genus` here. The minimal taxonomic information you have to provide is only the name of the phylogenetic rank matching the database you are using. So if you are using a genus-level database you will need a column `genus`. In this case we mill use a species-level database so we had to provide a column `genus`. If there any additional columns from the set `[\"kingdom\", \"phylum\", \"class\", \"order\", \"family\", \"genus\", \"species\"]` those will be used to make the mapping with the database more stringent. For instance, here we provided a column `genus` which means models will only be counted as a \"match\" if the taxon has the same genus *and* species in the data and the model database. Thus, the more phylogentic rank columns you include in the data you pass to MICOM, the more stringent MICOM will become matching to the reference database. This can be used to circumvent poorly matching ranks as well. For instance, if you know your data matches well by genus and phylum names but families are named differently even for the same taxa you can omit the `family` column from your data."

This will use the manifest we just generated but will also require a growth medium to be specified. A growth medium provided information which metabolites are available to the microbes for consumption and also provided an upper bound on the flux it is added to the system. This can be obtained from fluxomics data or approximated from growth media (for cultivation settings) or diet data (for gut microbiota models). Obtaining a correct media composition can be challenging. We will show some helper functions for that later on but for now we will use a pres-specified medium saved in Qiime 2 format. We also provide a growth medium describing an average Western diet for the AGORA model database at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3755182. \n",

Even when supplying putatively complete descriptions you will often observe that the models will predict the absence of growth since you are lacking an essential cofactor.
