        Each point denotes a single taxon in a single sample. Shown are the
        predicted growth rates only if growth was observed (growth rate larger
        than numerical tolerance of the solver).<br>
        Click a point to select points from only that sample. Click on an
        empty region of the plot to reset the selection.<br>
        Hover over each point to see its annotations. Use the "..." menu in the
        upper right hand side to export the plot into various formats.
