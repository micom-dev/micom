However, we observed that the highest correlation with replication rates is usually achieved at the largest tradeoff value that allows the majority of the taxa to grow. Thus, we can run cooperative tradeoff with varying tradeoff values and look for the characteristic elbow where the majority of the community can grow. This can be done by using the `plot_tradeoff` function. "
