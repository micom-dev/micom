        """Create a new community object.

        `micom` builds a community from a taxonomy which may simply be a list
        of model files in its simplest form. Usually, the taxonomy will contain
        additional information such as annotations for the individuals (for
        instance phylum, organims or species) and abundances.

        The recommended way to build a micom model is to supply a
        quantification of taxa (called "taxonomy" here) which specifies the
        taxonomic ranks for a taxon and its abundance, and a model database
        for a specific rank (for instance "genus"). MICOM will match the
        ranks from your taxonomy to the model database and assemble the
        community models from that. You will also get information about the
        construction process by calling `Community.build_metrics`.

        The most customizable way only takes a single table where summarization
        and matching to the reference database has already occured. In this
        case you will also provide paths to model files for each taxon. This is
        the "old" way but may still be applicable if you want to use a custom
        database or want full control of matching your data to reference
        models.

        Notes
        -----
        `micom` will automatically add exchange fluxes and and a community
        objective maximizing the overall growth rate of the community.

        Parameters
        ----------
        taxonomy : pandas.DataFrame
            The taxonomy used for building the model. Must have at least the
            column "id" or a column specifying a taxonomic rank.
            If no model database is specified in the next argument
            it furthermore requires a column "file" which specifies a filepath
            for each model. Valid file extensions are ".pickle", ".xml",
            ".xml.gz" and ".json". If a model database is specified this must
            contain at least a column with the same name as the rank used in
            the model database. Thus, for a genus-level database you will need
            a column `genus`. Additional taxa ranks can also be specified and
            will be used to be more stringent in taxa matching.
            Finally, the taxonomy should contain a column `abundance`. It will
            be used to quantify each individual in the community. If absent,
            MICOM will assume all individuals are present in the same amount.
        model_db : str
            A pre-built model database. If ending in `.qza` must be a Qiime 2
            artifact of type `MetabolicModels[JSON]`. Can also be a folder,
            zip (must end in `.zip`) file or None if the taxonomy contains a
            column `file`.
        id : str, optional
            The ID for the community. Should only contain letters and numbers,
            otherwise it will be formatted as such.
        name : str, optional
            The name for the community.
        rel_threshold : float < 1, optional
            The relative abundance threshold that will be used. Describes the
            smallest relative amount of an individual that will be considered
            non-zero. All individuals with a smaller relative amount will be
            omitted.
        solver : str, optional
            Which solver to use. Will default to cplex if available which is
            better suited for large problems.
        progress : bool, optional
            Show a progress bar.
        max_exchange : positive float, optional
            During model constructions exchange reactions are duplicated into
            internal and external exchange reactions. This specifies the new
            import flux bound for the *internal* exchange reaction. Import
            rates for the exchanges between the medium and outside are still
            mantained.
        mass : positive float, optional
            The total mass of the community in gDW. Used to adjust import
            fluxes which are assumed to be given as mmol/gDW*h for the
            entire community. As a consequence all import fluxes will be
            divided by that number.

        Attributes
        ----------
        taxa : list
            A list of taxa IDs in the community.

        OptCom methods are a group of optimization procedures to find community
        solutions that provide a tradeoff between the cooperative community
        growth and the egoistic growth of each individual [#c1]_. `micom`
        provides several strategies that can be used to find optimal solutions:

        - "moma": Minimization of metabolic adjustment. Simultaneously
          optimizes the community objective (maximize) and the cooperativity
          cost (minimize). This method finds an exact maximum but doubles the
          number of required variables, thus being slow.
        - "lmoma": The same as "moma" only with a linear
          representation of the cooperativity cost (absolute value).
        - "original": Solves the multi-objective problem described in [#c1]_.
          Here, the community growth rate is maximized simultanously with all
          individual growth rates. Note that there are usually many
          Pareto-optimal solutions to this problem and the method will only
          give one solution. This is also the slowest method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        community : micom.Community
            The community to optimize.
        strategy : str
            The strategy used to solve the OptCom formulation. Defaults to
            "lagrangian" which gives a decent tradeoff between speed and
            correctness.
        min_growth : float or array-like
            The minimal growth rate required for each individual. May be a
            single value or an array-like object with the same length as there
            are individuals.
        fluxes : boolean
            Whether to return the fluxes as well.
        pfba : boolean
            Whether to obtain fluxes by parsimonious FBA rather than
            "classical" FBA.

        Returns
        -------
        micom.CommunitySolution
            The solution of the optimization. If fluxes==False will only
