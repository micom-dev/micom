    weights : str

    Arguments

        The model to use.

        A growth medium. Must contain positive floats as elements and

        model will be removed from the growth medium.
    growth : positive float
        The minimum overall growth rate that has to be achieved. For single COBRA
        model this is just the biomass flux and for community models this is the
        community biomass flux.
    min_growth : positive float or array-like object.
        The minimum growth rate for each individual in the community. Either

    max_import: positive float

    weights : str

        scale by molecular mass, a single element which will scale by

        strict : list
        Whether to match the imports in the predefined medium exactly. For reactions IDs
        listed here will not allow additional import of the components in the provided
        medium. For example, if your input medium has a flux of 10 mmol/(gDW*h) defined
        and the requested growth rate can only be fulfilled by ramping this up that
        would be allowed in non-strict mode but forbidden in strict mode. To match all
