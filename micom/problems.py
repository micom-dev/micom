    """Add an objective to find the most "egoistic" solution.

    This adds an optimization objective finding a solution that maintains a
    (sub-)optimal community growth rate but is the closest solution to the
    community members individual maximal growth rates. So it basically finds
    the best possible tradeoff between maximizing community growth and
    individual (egoistic) growth. Here the objective is given as the sum of
    squared differences between the individuals current and maximal growth
    rate. In the linear case squares are substituted by absolute values
    (Manhattan distance).

    Arguments
    ---------
    community : micom.Community
        The community to modify.
    min_growth : positive float
        The minimal community growth rate that has to be mantained.
    linear : boolean
        Whether to use a non-linear (sum of squares) or linear version of the
        cooperativity cost. If set to False requires a QP-capable solver.
    max_gcs : None or dict
        The precomputed maximum individual growth rates.
