    Arguments
    ---------
    func : function
        A function that takes a single argument (can be any object) and

        An array-like object (list, tuple, numpy array, pandas Series, etc.)

    threads : positive int
        How many samples to analyze in parallel at once.
    description : str
        The dewscription shown in front of the progress bar.
    progress : bool
        Whether to show a progress bar.
