        specific.
    growth : positive float or pandas.Series
        The minimum growth rate the model has to achieve with the (fixed) medium. If
        a Series will have a minimum growth rate for each id/taxon in the model db.
    max_added_import : positive float
        Maximum import flux for each added additional import not included in the growth
        medium. If positive will expand the medium with additional imports in order to
        fulfill the growth objective.
    minimize_components : boolean
        Whether to minimize the number of components instead of the total
        import flux. Might be more intuitive if set to True but may also be
        slow to calculate.
    weights : str
        Will scale the fluxes by a weight factor. Can either be "mass" which will
        scale by molecular mass, a single element which will scale by
        the elemental content (for instance "C" to scale by carbon content).
        If None every metabolite will receive the same weight.
        Will be ignored if `minimize_components` is True.
    threads : int >=1
        The number of parallel workers to use when building models. As a
        rule of thumb you will need around 1GB of RAM for each thread.
    strict : list
        Whether to match the imports in the predefined medium exactly. For reactions IDs
        listed here will not allow additional import of the components in the provided
        medium. For example, if your input medium has a flux of 10 mmol/(gDW*h) defined
        and the requested growth rate can only be fulfilled by ramping this up that
        would be allowed in non-strict mode but forbidden in strict mode. To match all
        medium components to strict mode use `strict=medium.global_id`.
