    This requires specification of either the minimal community growth rate,
    a minimal taxon growth rate that has to be reachable by all taxa in the sample
    simultaneously, or a combination of both. All imports will be opened and the
    minimal medium allowing those growth rates will be returned. What exactly is being
    minimized (mass flux, carbon flux, number of components) can be specified through
    the `weights` and `minimize_components` options.

    Note
    ----
    A common usage example would be to request some realistic growth rate for the entire
    community and a very low growth rate for all taxa to ensure they are growing ("alive")
    in the medium. The returned solution comes from the medium minimization problem and
    does not have to correspond to the cooperative tradeoff solution with the same medium.

    Arguments
    ---------
    manifest : pandas.DataFrame
        The manifest as returned by the `build` workflow.
    model_folder : str
        The folder in which to find the files mentioned in the manifest.
    medium : pandas.Series or pandas.DataFrame
        A growth medium with exchange reaction IDs as index and positive
        import fluxes as values. If a DataFrame needs columns `flux` and
        `reaction`.
    community_growth : positive float
        The minimum community-wide growth rate that has to be achieved on the created
        medium.
    growth : positive float, dict, or pd.Series
        The taxon-specific growth rates that have to be achieved. If a single float gives
        the growth rate for each individual taxon. If a dict or Series gives the growth
        rate for each taxon specified that way. Here keys are the IDs for the taxon.
    minimize_components : boolean
        Whether to minimize the number of media components rather than the
        total flux. This will ignore the weight argument and might be very slow.
    weights : str
        Will scale the fluxes by a weight factor. Can either be "mass" which will
        scale by molecular mass, a single element which will scale by
        the elemental content (for instance "C" to scale by carbon content).
        If None every metabolite will receive the same weight.
        Will be ignored if `minimize_components` is True.
    summarize: boolean
        Whether to summarize the medium across all samples. If False will
        return a medium for each sample.
    threads: int
        The number of processes to use.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame or tuple of pandas.DataFrame and GrowthResult
        Either the medium or, if `solution=True` a tuple of the medium and the
        growth results.
