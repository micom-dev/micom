    Parameters
    ----------
    manifest : pandas.DataFrame
        The manifest as returned by the `build` workflow.
    model_folder : str
        The folder in which to find the files mentioned in the manifest.
    medium : pandas.DataFrame
        A growth medium. Must have columns "reaction" and "flux" denoting
        exchnage reactions and their respective maximum flux.
    tradeoffs : array of floats in (0.0, 1.0]
        An array of tradeoff vaues to be tested. One simulation without
        a tradeoff (no cooperative tradeoff) will always be run additionally
        and will have a tradeoff of "NaN".
    threads : int >=1
        The number of parallel workers to use when building models. As a
        rule of thumb you will need around 1GB of RAM for each thread.
    atol : float
        Absolute tolerance for the growth rates. If None will use the solver tolerance.
    rtol : float
        Relative tolerqance for the growth rates. If None will use the solver tolerance.
    presolve : bool
        Whether to use the presolver/scaling. Can improve numerical accuracy in some
        cases.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        The predicted growth rates.
