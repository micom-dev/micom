      <p class="subtitle">
        The left plot shows a 2D histogram of growth rates on the log-scale
        across samples for each tradeoff value. Zero growth rates have been
        set to 1e-6 in this plot to make them visible.<br>
        The right plot denotes the fraction of taxa that grow (growth rate larger
        1e-6) in each sample. Each point denotes a single sample under a given
        tradeoff value. The red line denotes the median across all samples. You
        can click on a point to show only points from that particular sample.
        <br>
        Use the "..." menu in the
        upper right hand side to export the plot into various formats.
